# Small Business Cashflow management

## Objective: To create an adaptive cashflow forecasting tool for small business to better manage working capital



Cashflow projection by day, week, month

Beginning balance + cashflow = ending balance

Most conservative Case:
Invoice Due Date
Invoice Amount
Invoice Origination Date

Update from USAA:
Check balance, vendor name
Update cashflow
