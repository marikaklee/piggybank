# Small Business Cashflow management

## Objective: To create an adaptive cashflow forecasting tool for small business to better manage working capital

1. Cashflow projection (Worst case scenario): Customers pay at the last possible due date

  - Cashflow is projected based on the final invoice due date
  - Users can see projection by day, week, month

    Beginning balance + cashflow over time period = ending balance
